 luxembourg.1.t:0 "An invitation to the Benelux"
 luxembourg.1.d:0 "While small in stature, Luxembourg has grown quite active poltiically in recent years, owing to the increasingly belligerent nature of her neighbours. Prime Minister Joseph Bech has argued that the lowland countries should band together, before our fates are decided for us."

After an incredibly close referendum rejecting the law, Prime Minister Joseph Bech has had no choice but offer his resignation, fellow Ritespartei founder Pierre Dupong will now lead the country."
