 VIN_encourage_inter_party_democracy_desc:0 "Despite the existence of a single revolutionary party, it must be open to different ways of approaching and developing Vietnamese socialism.

 VIN_establish_the_regional_parliaments:0 "Establish The Regionals Parliaments"
 VIN_establish_the_regional_parliaments_desc:0 "A good way to help in local representation would be to create a parliament for each of Vietnam's three regions: Cochin China, Annam and Tonkin. This parliament would be just below the federal parliament in terms of power, and could take decisions, particularly on the budget."
