NIC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The scars of Augusto Caesar Sandino's rebellion against the government and the American occupation troops are still visible on Nicaraguan society and politics, even more so since the collapse of the economy, mainly based on coffee exports, following the Great Depression.\n\nJuan Bautista Sacasa, who became president in 1933, saw and is partly responsible for the rise to power of the head of the national guard, Anastasio Somoza García, who had taken charge of Sandino's murder in 1934.\n\nIt seems that the fall of Sacasa is near...."

NIC_president_Somoza_Garcia_desc:0 "Now that the era of puppet presidents is over, it is time for Somoza to take full control of Nicaragua."
NIC_The_preservation_of_true_democracy:0 "The Preservation of True Democracy"
NIC_reinstate_national_guard_control:0 "Reinstate National Guard Control"
NIC_reinstate_national_guard_control_desc:0 "Now that the limits imposed on candidates are no longer on the agenda, Somoza can resume his role as head of the National Guard, which, combined with the position of President, should give him full control over Nicaragua's armed forces."
NIC_nkvd_assistance:0 "NKVD Assistance"
NIC_nkvd_assistance_desc:0 "We can learn a lot from the NKVD, whose effectiveness is no longer in question. Now that our relations with the Soviet Union are at their best, we could ask them to send some high-ranking members of their secret services to train our own."
NIC_the_strength_of_moscow:0 "The Strength of Moscow"
NIC_the_strength_of_moscow_desc:0 "An alliance with the United States as much as with Germany could end up threatening our sovereignty and above all Somoza's legitimacy. An alliance with the Soviet Union, however unlikely it may be, could well be the most beneficial."
NIC_begin_a_political_crackdown:0 "Begin a Purge of the Opposition"
NIC_begin_a_political_crackdown_desc:0 "A few voices continue to doubt Somoza's legitimacy despite a very clear election victory. We can tolerate a small opposition, as long as it does not or only slightly affect the elites, while for the most radical, they will suffer the same fate as Sandino."
NIC_supervise_large_enterprises:0 "Supervise Large Enterprises"

NIC_judicial_control:0 "Judicial Control"
NIC_judicial_control_desc:0 "Many Somoza relatives have been assigned to judicial roles, ensuring that we have full cooperation from this branch."
NIC_take_over_the_national_radio:0 "Take Over the National Radio"
NIC_take_over_the_national_radio_desc:0 "The Somoza family's control of the national radio station will allow pro-regime propaganda to be broadcast to the entire population of Nicaragua."
NIC_support_of_the_psn:0 "Support of the PSN"
NIC_support_of_the_psn_desc:0 "Paradoxically, the Partido Socialista Nicaragüense proclaimed its support for Anastasio Somoza García, seeing him as an anti-fascist ally. With their support, our regime will probably be better seen not only by the Nicaraguan left, but by the world."
NIC_begin_forcibly_annexing_nicaraguan_german_land:0 "Begin Annexing Nicaraguan-German Land"
NIC_begin_forcibly_annexing_nicaraguan_german_land_desc:0 "We can use the war with Germany to force the small but influential German community in Nicaragua to sell their possessions and land for a bite, so that it can be bought by Somoza's relatives and family."
NIC_the_somoza_family_fortune:0 "The Somoza Family Fortune"
NIC_the_somoza_family_fortune_desc:0 "Somoza's family's almost total control over Nicaragua's economy and politics has allowed her to amass a substantial fortune and control a huge part of the land."
NIC_soviet_economic_assistance:0 "Soviet Economic Assistance"
NIC_soviet_economic_assistance_desc:0 "The industrial success of the USSR is unquestionable. Perhaps we, too, as a small agrarian nation, could become a fully industrialized nation following the Russian model?"
NIC_combat_fruit_industries_influence:0 "Combat the Fruit Industry's Influence"
NIC_combat_fruit_industries_influence_desc:0 "The influence of the United Fruit Company on Nicaragua is beginning to become embarrassing, not only for the Somoza family but also for our Soviet allies. It is time to put an end to their influence."
NIC_look_to_washington_once_again:0 "Look to Washington Once Again"
NIC_look_to_washington_once_again_desc:0 "In this global conflict, our place is with America, without whom Somoza would never have found itself in its current position."
NIC_lend_lease_for_docking_rights:0 "Lend Lease for Docking Rights"
NIC_lend_lease_for_docking_rights_desc:0 "In exchange for support in terms of armaments, we could offer the United States the right to park their ships in our ports in order to help them control the Caribbean."
NIC_foreign_concessions_on_gold_exploitation:0 "Foreign Concessions on Gold Exploitation"
NIC_foreign_concessions_on_gold_exploitation_desc:0 "By making concessions to American companies for gold, rubber and wood, we could ensure strong economic support for Nicaragua."
NIC_ally_the_champion_of_europe:0 "Ally the Champion of Europe"
NIC_ally_the_champion_of_europe_desc:0 "It is clear that Germany is Europe's new master power. By joining forces with them, we could ensure that Nicaragua receives a share in the new order."
NIC_push_south:0 "Strike South"
NIC_push_south_desc:0 "To the south is Costa Rica, a weak nation led by a similarly weak government. By invading them, we could prove the effectiveness of the Nicaraguan army to our new allies."

NIC_expanded_national_guard_powers:0 "Expand National Guard Powers"

NIC_uproot_banditry:0 "Uproot Banditry"
NIC_uproot_banditry_desc:0 "Nicaragua's cruel terrain has allowed groups of bandits to form and easily attack the central government. It is time to put an end to it."
NIC_supervise_large_enterprises:0 "Supervise Large Enterprises"
NIC_supervise_large_enterprises_desc:0 "Without interfering with their operations, we must ensure that Nicaragua's leading companies are aligned with the government's interests and objectives."

NIC_health_services_desc:0 "Access to decent care remains limited in some parts of Nicaragua, yet a sick population is a weak population. It is time to expand access to health care."
